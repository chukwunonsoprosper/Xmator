# Xmator – Smart Auto-Unfollow for X (Twitter) 🚀

Xmator is an advanced automation script that helps you intelligently clean up your following list on X (formerly Twitter). Unlike basic mass-unfollow scripts, Xmator ensures you never unfollow tech-related accounts, keeping your network valuable and relevant.

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Intelligent Filtering** – Checks user bios before unfollowing. If a bio contains tech-related keywords (e.g., "tech," "developer," "AI," "coding," "startup"), Xmator skips that user.
- ✅ **Seamless Unfollowing** – Clicks the unfollow button, waits for the confirmation popup, and confirms the action automatically.
- ✅ **Auto-Scrolling** – If no unfollow buttons are found, Xmator scrolls down to load more accounts and continues the process.
- ✅ **Anti-Detection Delays** – Optimized timing between actions to mimic human behavior, reducing the risk of detection.
- ✅ **Fully Automated** – Just run it once, and it will unfollow users continuously until the task is complete.

## 🛠 How to Use Xmator

1. Open X (Twitter) in your browser and go to your Following list.
2. Open Developer Console:
    - On Windows: Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + J` (Chrome) / `Ctrl + Shift + K` (Firefox).
    - On Mac: Press `Cmd + Option + J` (Chrome) / `Cmd + Option + K` (Firefox).
3. Copy & Paste the Xmator script into the console and hit Enter.
4. Sit back and relax – Xmator will handle the unfollowing process for you!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- 🚨 **Use responsibly** – X (Twitter) has limits on unfollowing. Running this script too frequently may lead to restrictions on your account.
- 🛑 **To stop Xmator**, refresh the page or close the tab.

📌 Perfect for decluttering your following list while keeping meaningful tech connections!
