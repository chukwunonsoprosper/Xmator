# Xmator â€“ Twitter Auto Follow/Unfollow Extension

ðŸš€ Xmator is a powerful Chrome extension that automates following and unfollowing Twitter users based on specific keywords in their bio.

âš  **Warning**
This extension interacts with Twitter's interface; use it responsibly. Excessive automated actions may result in temporary restrictions on your account. Ensure compliance with Twitterâ€™s terms of service to avoid penalties.

## Features

âœ… Follow users whose bio contains specific keywords  
âœ… Unfollow users who donâ€™t match your criteria  
âœ… Works automatically while scrolling  
âœ… Customizable keyword filtering

1. Download or clone this repository.
    - **Firefox (Windows/Linux)**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + K`

## Configuration
